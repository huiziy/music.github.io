## Music and Memory Retention Project Intro

our study aims to determine whether listening to music (more specifically which type of music) have an effect on the performance of memory test for elders. We chose Latin Square in order to control for the variability in participants and the time memory test took place. We chose 25 male islanders, from `The Island`[^1], aged 65 to 89 from the town Macondo to perform 5x5 Latin Square 5 times (each Latin Square contained 5 participants). Regarding the data gathering process, we first administer the "Memory Test Card" task, wait 5 minutes, then adminster the treatment (listening to 4 types of music or no music), wait 10 minutes for treatment to take effect, and then conduct the "Memory Test Card" again. The difference between two "Memory Test Card" scores are recorded. After data collection, we first analyzed the box plots for each individual Latin Square, then we created 6 ANOVA tables (5 for individual Latin Squares and 1 for the combined model). The results showed that music is statistically significant in 2 out of the 5 Latin Squares, but not significant in the overall model. Further research topics are also discussed.
